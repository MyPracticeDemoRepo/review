# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, label = "cars"}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots {#plots}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, label = "pressure", echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure, col = "blue", pch = 19)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Mathematics


The equation for the sample mean ($\bar{x}$) is given in Equation \@ref(eq:mean).  After Equation  \@ref(eq:mean), insert a code chunk that recreates the plot from Section \@ref(plots) but change the plotting character color to red and add a descriptive figure caption.

\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{n}
(\#eq:mean)
\end{equation}

```{r, label = "plots2", fig.cap = "Your descriptive figure caption"}
plot(pressure, col = "red", pch = 19)
```
